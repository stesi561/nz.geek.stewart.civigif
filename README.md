# nz.geek.stewart.civigif

Sandbox extension - WIP - exploring generating a gif of (currently)
contribution data that could be included in an email campaign as a
up-to-date donor roll.


Todo:

* Possibly better to generate the image once every cron run rather on page load?
* Need options for filtering by campaign etc - and to set this via a gui - and to generate new images for each email.


The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Requirements

* PHP v7.0+
* CiviCRM (*FIXME: Version number*)
